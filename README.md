# Wearwell
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è WearWell ‚Äî Running Buddy App
üìò Project Overview

WearWell is a web-based prototype designed to help users find running partners, track shared goals, and stay motivated through social support and wearable integration.
This project was designed for DECO3500 ‚Äì Social & Mobile Computing course at The University of Queensland.

## Research and Requirements Summary

- People who exercise alone often lose motivation and struggle to maintain consistent routines over time.  
- Building social connections and shared accountability can significantly increase long-term exercise engagement.


Key Functions:

- Find Nearby Runners ‚Äî Find running partners near you based on location, pace, and running level.

- Shared Goals ‚Äî Set and track shared goals with your running partner, viewing both individual and shared common progress in real time.

- Real-Time Tracking ‚Äî Get instant feedback through synced wearable devices and stayed motivated

This prototype demostrates how social and mobile technologies can enhance individuals' motivation, engagment and workout habbits.

### Testing and Improvement
Through usability testing of the Running Buddy prototype, we discovered that users struggled with setting their running level, understanding the matching logic, and confirming run appointments. To address these issues, the team optimized the level description cards, added location coordinates, and implemented a quick run appointment feature within the chat interface. These improvements significantly improved operational clarity and matching efficiency, bringing the app closer to real-world user needs.

# Running Buddy Prototype ‚Äî Quick Start & Usage Guide

A concise README-style guide for launching and demoing the prototype with our tech flow (wearable ‚Üí Edge Link ‚Üí mobile app ‚Üí matching ‚Üí shared session).

## What‚Äôs in this repo

* `index.html` ‚Äî Home (map) & nearby runners
* `login.html` ‚Äî Sign in / Sign up
* `profile.html` ‚Äî Runner profile (pace, weekly frequency, goals‚Ä¶)
* `match.html` ‚Äî Match flow and invitations
* `schedule.html` ‚Äî Pick time, place, and distance
* `notifications.html` ‚Äî Invites & status updates
* `shared-goal.html` ‚Äî Synchronized session (countdown + calorie target)
*  Running Buddy simulator ‚Äî **Wearable simulator** (sensors)
*  Running Buddy bluetooth app - HC05
* `pwa_files/` ‚Äî PWA manifest & icons
* `start_pwa.sh` ‚Äî Helper script to run a local server

---

## Prerequisites

* A laptop/phone with **Chrome or Edge** (Web Bluetooth supported).
* Bluetooth turned **on**.
* Location Services enabled (for the map).
* Optional: two browser windows/devices to show both sides of a match.

> **Tip:** Web Bluetooth works on **https** or **localhost**. Running locally is fine.

---

## 1) Start the platform (PWA)

**Option A (recommended):**

```bash
bash start_pwa.sh
```

This serves the site at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown in your terminal).

**Option B (manual):**

```bash
# any simple static server works; for example:
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in Chrome/Edge.

---

## 2) Start the wearable **simulator**

1. Open `demo.html` in a second tab (or second device).
2. Click **Start Sensors** to simulate:

   * Optical heart rate & SpO‚ÇÇ
   * Accelerometer/steps
   * Clock

---

## 3) Pair over Bluetooth (Edge Link)

1. In the app (main tab), open the **Connect Wearable** control (header or settings).
2. Select the simulated device.
3. Once paired, sensor data aggregates on the device and streams to the phone via **Bluetooth**.

---

## 4) Sign in / Sign up

1. Go to `login.html`.
2. Create an account or log in.
3. The app may ask to **read your location** ‚Äî choose **Allow** (needed for nearby matches).

---

## 5) Home (Map) & Context

* Open `index.html`.
* The app adds **place** (your location) and **time window** to your context.
* Nearby runners appear as **avatars** on the map.

---

## 6) Find a partner

**Manual pick:**

* Tap a nearby avatar to preview.

**Recommended:**

* Use **Recommended** to auto-filter by your **pace band + distance + free time**.

---

## 7) View runner details

* Open the runner‚Äôs **profile** (`profile.html`).
* Check **pace**, **weekly frequency**, **goals**, and other basic stats.
* Decide: **Start Match** or **Go Back** to pick someone else.

---

## 8) Start a match & invite

1. In `match.html`, tap **Invite**.
2. The other runner receives a **push/notification** (`notifications.html`).
3. When they **Accept**, proceed to session setup.

---

## 9) Confirm session details

* In `schedule.html`, both runners set/confirm:

  * **Time & place**
  * **Planned distance**

* After confirming, you join a **waiting list / lobby** until start time.

---

## 10) Run together (synchronized session)

* At start time, both devices switch to the **synchronized session script** (`shared-goal.html`):

  * **Countdown** to begin
  * **Calorie target** (shared goal) shown to both sides
* During the run, each device continues sending sensor updates (HR/SpO‚ÇÇ, steps, time).

---

## 11) Completion & records

* When finished, each device sends a **completion event**.
* The app generates a **shared completion card** and writes the run to your **history** (profile).

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Bluetooth pairing fails:**

  * Refresh both tabs, ensure Chrome/Edge, and try again on **localhost/https**.
  * Turn Bluetooth off/on, close other apps that might hold the adapter.

* **Map doesn‚Äôt show your position:**

  * Re-allow **Location** permissions; check system Location Services.

* **No nearby runners:**

  * Open a second browser/device and log in as another user; or use **Recommended** to widen distance/time.

* **PWA install prompt missing:**

  * Keep the site open for a minute; look for ‚ÄúInstall app‚Äù in the browser menu.

---

## Demo flow (60-second walkthrough)

1. Start server ‚Üí open `index.html`.
2. Open Running Buddy simulator ‚Üí **Start Sensors**.
3. Pair via **Connect Wearable**.
4. **Log in**, allow **Location**.
5. Pick avatar **or** tap **Recommended**.
6. Open **profile**, tap **Start Match** ‚Üí send invite.
7. Accept on the second device, set **time/place/distance**.
8. Enter **shared session** (countdown + calorie goal).
9. Finish ‚Üí show **completion card** in history.

---

**That‚Äôs it ‚Äî the prototype now demonstrates the full tech route from sensors to shared, synchronized runs.**
